# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of People Over Party, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of political affiliation, age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Engaging in good-faith dialogue across differences

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Partisan attacks or attempts to use the project for political campaigning
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Nonpartisan Commitment

This project is explicitly **nonpartisan**. We welcome contributors of all political perspectives. Our goal is civic engagement and education, not advocacy for any party, candidate, or political position.

Contributions that attempt to introduce partisan bias will not be accepted.

## King Center Principles

Our community interactions are guided by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Six Principles of Nonviolence:

1. **Courageous Resistance** - Stand up for what's right, respectfully
2. **Friendship and Understanding** - Seek reconciliation, not victory
3. **Target Issues, Not People** - Criticize ideas, not individuals
4. **Redemptive Engagement** - Believe in the power of dialogue
5. **Choose Love Over Hate** - Respond to hostility with understanding
6. **Faith in Justice** - Trust that good-faith engagement works

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and will take appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers may:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
- Temporarily or permanently ban contributors for inappropriate behavior

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:
- Opening an issue (for public matters)
- Emailing hello@peopleoverpartysd.com (for private matters)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with additions reflecting the nonpartisan mission of People Over Party.
