## What is a PAC?

A **Political Action Committee (PAC)** is an organization that raises and spends money to elect or defeat candidates. However, if your focus is **civic education** rather than candidate advocacy, you may want to consider a different structure.

### Common Structures for Civic Engagement

| Structure | Purpose | Tax Status | Can Endorse Candidates? |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------------------|
| **PAC** | Elect/defeat candidates | Not tax-exempt | Yes |
| **501(c)(4)** | Social welfare, civic education | Tax-exempt (donations not deductible) | Limited |
| **501(c)(3)** | Educational, charitable | Tax-exempt (donations deductible) | No |

**Better Together: People Over Party** operates as a PAC that focuses on civic education without endorsing candidates. This allows flexibility while maintaining a nonpartisan mission.

## The "People Over Party" Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Nonpartisan by Design** - We educate citizens without telling them how to vote
2. **Civic Engagement First** - Democracy works when people participate
3. **Common Ground Focus** - Find what unites us, not what divides us
4. **Respect Across Differences** - Engage with those who think differently

### The King Center Foundation

Our approach is inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s [Six Principles of Nonviolence](https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/the-king-philosophy/):

1. **Courageous Resistance** - Active resistance to injustice, not passive acceptance
2. **Friendship and Understanding** - The goal is reconciliation, creating "Beloved Community"
3. **Targeting Evil, Not People** - Distinguishing between wrongdoers and wrong actions
4. **Redemptive Suffering** - Voluntary suffering for justice can educate and transform
5. **Love Over Hate** - Resisting through understanding and creative love
6. **Faith in Justice** - Deep conviction that justice will ultimately prevail

### Six Steps for Nonviolent Social Change

1. **Information Gathering** - Research all perspectives
2. **Education** - Inform and gain support through knowledge
3. **Personal Commitment** - Prepare for the work ahead
4. **Negotiation** - Engage respectfully to highlight issues
5. **Direct Action** - Apply creative pressure when needed
6. **Reconciliation** - Seek friendship and collaborative resolution

## Choosing Your Structure

### Questions to Ask

1. **Will you endorse candidates?**
   - Yes → PAC
   - No → 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(3)

2. **Do you want donations to be tax-deductible?**
   - Yes → 501(c)(3) (but very limited political activity)
   - No → PAC or 501(c)(4)

3. **Will you lobby for legislation?**
   - Heavily → 501(c)(4)
   - Minimally → 501(c)(3)
   - Not at all → Any structure

### Recommended for Civic Education

If your goal is similar to People Over Party (educate voters, encourage participation, remain nonpartisan), consider:

- **501(c)(4) Social Welfare Organization** - Best balance of flexibility and credibility
- **PAC with nonpartisan bylaws** - If you want the option to eventually endorse

5. **Open a bank account** - Dedicated account for organization funds
